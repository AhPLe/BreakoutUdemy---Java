# BreakoutUdemy---Java
A slightly modified program of Udemy's breakout: https://www.udemy.com/a-practical-intro-to-java-using-games/learn/lecture/2271238?start=690#overview
Modifications include - more variables to streamline and improve some of the 'magic numbers' from the original code.
I received a certificate from this course and used it to create the Tetris program I have. Which may continue to be modified.

The code was as a template to create the Tetris program to show some capability in Java. Neither is particularly polished, 
but some of the functions in Tetris were very neat to create.
